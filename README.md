# UWP Cloud Vision API Client
A small client that enables you to use the Google Cloud Vision API Beta from Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications using an API key for authentication.

You can use the class library with your Universal Windows Applications (UWP) for Windows 10 and your Windows 8.1 apps. Please refer to [Google Cloud Vision API Website](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) and [API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/) for more information on the Google Cloud Vision API.

You will need to sign up for the Google Cloud Services first, enable the Cloud Vision API and create an API Key.
